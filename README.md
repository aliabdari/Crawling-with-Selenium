# Crawling websites with Selenium
In this repository, we discuss how to crawl different data from websites with python selenium library.<br/>
The main purpose of Selenium is for testing web pages. It is an open-source web-based automation tool.<br/>
But by using various functions in selenium we can access to numerous us types of data, that then we can use them for many purposes like gathering dataset for machine learning tasks.</br>

## Essential functions
We have some essential functions in selenium that we learn them here with each other.

1) Initializing the web driver<br/>
Selenium for doing its work opens a browser. The browser can be chrome or firefox that has UI or phantomjs browser that does not have UI. It's trivial that phanstomjs would be faster than the others, but we can see the process by our eyes. So it's a good way to do our develope and debugs with chrome or firefox, and for the final version of our code, we replace them with phantomjs to speed up our work.
for this purpose, we should initialize the webdriver for our navigation in a web webpage. So first we import webdriver<br>
from selenium import webdriver<br>
And then we initialize our driver with the path of our browser driver.<br>
```
driver = webdriver.Chrome('path_to_driver/chromedriver')
```

2) getting the URL<br/>
The second important function is get().<br/>
We should invoke the function with an URL to say the browser to open the desired web page that we want to navigate it.<br/>
```
driver.get(URL)
```

3) wait function<br/>
Some web sites use ajax to loading different data on the web page. In these cases, all of the data are not accessible as the first time that the web page is opened in a browser. Some data will be load little by little over time. In this situation, we do not have any solution just to wait for that data to become visible!!!!<br/>
We have two types of waiting in selenium:<br/>
* implicitly wait<br/>
```
driver.implicitly_wait(5)
```
* explicitly wait (waiting that an element become visible)<br/>
```
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
WebElement element = wait.until(
        ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("someid")));
```
